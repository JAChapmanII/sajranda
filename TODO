Implement a proper movement system
	-- can only accelerate in direction of thrusters
	-- must turn at an appropriate rate
	-- speed should not be based on distance to target
		-- maybe there will be some slow-down from cruise-speed near end though
	-- path plotting? bezier on waypoints or something?
		-- could use same system, but break path into multiple sub-points

Needs data format to support multiple properties
	-- acceleration rates on all axes
		-- thruster location/theta/strength
	-- health/sheilds?/fuel?/armor?
		-- regeneration rates
	-- weapons
		-- targeting
			-- avoding

Resources?
	-- how many
	-- how to get

UI?
	-- close
	-- menus
		-- main menu
	-- zooming in/out
	-- panning
	-- view rotation

Factories
	-- different kinds for different classes of unit?

Factions
	-- story or premise?
	-- set number of "main" factions or just unlimited?
	-- set up own units
		-- limited to certain number
			-- units of factions you capture don't count
		-- set design, thrusters
			-- maybe make a unit that can only go forward
			-- ones with omni-directional thrusters
		-- unique abilities
			-- based on design?
			-- limited number that are assignable

Logging
	Is any needed? This early in the game probably not, but hard to retro-fit
		-- or once it gets to some 'alpha' version, start putting in logging where
		   it seems to crash, and leave it out everywhere else

Optimize
	Selection system
		-- ~120 SLOC to do selection
			-- invert some of the logic, or use a function pointer
		-- seems there is a lot of redundancy
		-- vector of what was selected, and just re-select it if shift is down?
		-- UI portion of this
			-- draws the model 3 times when selected, extra duplicated code
				-- function to render with radius multiplier?
			-- other way to signify as selected?
