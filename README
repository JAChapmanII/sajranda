sajranda is going to be an game in the RTS genre, right now it is nothing

"sajranda" is a lojban word for "conscious surrender" which is meant to
emphasize the (eventually/hopefully) large number of options for diplomacy, and
allowing various factions to surrender only parts of control from their empire.

Compiling:
	Debug version:
		make

	Release version:
		make release=yes

	Note: To switch from a debug to a release version, run
		make clean
	in between them.

	There are other options, but you should only need them if you are a
	developer, in which case you know how to read a Makefile

Running:
	./bin/sajranda

File formats:
	*.model
		Binary format, which currently consists of a byte and long double's
		First is a single byte:
			The MSB (high bit) is used as a bool flag determing whether or not this
			mesh is symmetrical. If it is, it is assumed half the mesh is given
			The last seven bits are the number of points expected in the model. A
			max of 127 is imposed by the number of bits in this value
		The first three long doubles are the r, g, and b parts of the mesh color
		Next are a series of zero or more points (using polar coordinates):
			The first long double of a point is the theta (in radians / pi)
			The second long double is the radius length of this point

		Note: if the number of points does not match the number in the byte
		header, an error will be thrown

	*.in
		This is a human editable format used to hand-make models. Each of these
		are compiled upon first use for speed/efficiency on later loads.
		This format closely resembles the *.model format it compiles into.

		The first letter should be a 'y' or 'n' (case insensitive). The word this
		letter is attached to is thrown away to allow for "yes", "no", etc. This
		is mapped to a boolean value telling wether or not this model is symmetric

		Next is a non-negative integer that should be <= 127. It is read % 128.
		This is the number of points that should be after this in the file.

		Next is a series of points in polar coordinates
			the first long double read will be used as theta (in radians / pi)
			the second is the radius length (in units)

		If the number of points read does not match the number from the header,
		and error will be thrown and the file will not be compiled
